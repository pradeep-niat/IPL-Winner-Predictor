# 🏏 IPL Winner Predictor - ML Web App

This is a machine learning-powered web application built using **Readdy AI** that predicts the winning probability of IPL teams based on match inputs. The project uses a classification model trained on historical IPL match data to estimate which team has a higher chance of winning.

> ✅ Created as part of InternPe Week 3 ML Project Task.
